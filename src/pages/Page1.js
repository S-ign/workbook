            your unconscious mind. Itâ€™s also a natural state in which you are in control of how you
            think, feel, and behave.
            Hypnosis is very useful for helping your unconscious mind accept beliefs that you may
            have spent your entire life not believing. Some people believe they cannot become fit and
            strong, or that they cannot eliminate anxiety from their lives, or that they cannot stop
            using a substance that is harming them."
